## ✨ Features

### 🛡️ Uncompromised Security
- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** Utilizes `RSA-OAEP` (2048-bit) for secure key exchange and `AES-GCM` (256-bit) for message encryption.
- **Client-Side Cryptography:** Keys are generated, stored, and utilized entirely within the browser using the Web Crypto API. The server never sees your private keys or plaintext messages.
- **Secure Authentication:** Implementation of JWT-based authentication, bcrypt password hashing, and rate-limiting (`express-rate-limit`) to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **Helmet Protected:** HTTP headers are secured against common vulnerabilities.

### 💬 Real-Time Messaging & Calling
- **Instant Messaging:** Real-time text communication powered by `Socket.IO`.
- **Private & Group Chats:** Support for one-on-one encrypted messaging as well as secure group chats with shared encrypted keys.
- **Voice Calling:** High-quality, real-time voice calling using `WebRTC`. Supports peer-to-peer private calls and Mesh network-based group calls.

### 💰 Credit-Based System
- **Economy & Credits:** Users begin with free credits. Additional credits can be requested through the platform.
- **Administrative Control:** Admins can review, approve, or reject credit requests via a dedicated dashboard.

### 👨‍💻 Admin Panel
- Comprehensive dashboard for managing the platform.
- Capabilities to ban/unban users, delete accounts, and manage all credit transactions.
- Automated creation of a default admin account on initial startup.

### 🎨 Modern UI/UX
- Responsive, dynamic, and premium interface built with Vanilla CSS.
- Dedicated Marketing, About Us (`about.html`), and Secure Contact (`contact.html`) pages.
- Profile customization with avatar file uploads (`multer`).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) (Optional, required for scaling)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SecureConnect.git
   cd SecureConnect
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory. **`JWT_SECRET` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` are mandatory.**
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_custom_admin_password
   NODE_ENV=development
   
   # Optional: Redis URL for Socket.IO scaling (e.g., redis://localhost:6379)
   # REDIS_URL=
   ```

4. **Initialize the Database:**
   The SQLite database will be automatically created and initialized via Sequelize upon starting the server.

5. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   # For development (using nodemon)
   npm run dev

   # For production
   npm start
   ```

6. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Default Admin Credentials
Upon the first startup, a default admin account is created if one does not exist:
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `Password@2026` (or the value set in `ADMIN_PASSWORD`)

## 🏗️ Architecture & Security Model

1. **Key Generation:** When a user registers, their device generates an RSA-2048 key pair.
2. **Key Storage:** The Public Key is sent to the server. The Private Key is encrypted using AES-GCM (derived from the user's password using PBKDF2) and then stored on the server for syncing across devices.
3. **Message Encryption:** 
   - A random AES-256 key is generated for every message.
   - The message is encrypted using this AES key.
   - The AES key is then encrypted using the recipient's RSA Public Key.
   - Both the encrypted message and the encrypted AES key are sent to the server.
4. **Message Decryption:** The recipient retrieves the payload, decrypts the AES key using their locally unencrypted RSA Private Key, and then decrypts the message.
5. **Group Encryption:** A group admin generates a communal AES key. This key is individually encrypted with every group member's RSA Public Key and distributed. All group messages are encrypted symmetrically with this group AES key.

## 🚢 Deployment

SecureConnect includes a pre-configured GitHub Actions workflow (`deploy.yml`) for deploying to an AWS EC2 instance.

**To deploy:**
1. Configure your repository secrets:
   - `HOST_DNS`: Your EC2 instance URL/IP.
   - `USERNAME`: SSH username (e.g., `ubuntu`).
   - `EC2_SSH_KEY`: Your SSH private key.
2. Push your changes to the `online` branch.
3. The GitHub Action will automatically pull the code, install dependencies, and restart the PM2 process.
